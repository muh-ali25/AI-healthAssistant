# AI-healthAssistant

This project is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based AI Health Chatbot designed to provide reliable, context-aware responses to general health queries.
The system retrieves relevant information from uploaded medical documents and combines it with a powerful LLM to generate accurate and grounded answers.

The application uses:

React for the user-friendly frontend

FastAPI for backend API services

Pinecone for vector search

Sentence Transformers for embeddings

LLM (Gemini) for answer generation
